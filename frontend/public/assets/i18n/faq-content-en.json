            "question": "Where can I find details about an artwork?",
            "answer": "In the navigation bar, you can find the collection of all artworks under the \"Gallery\" tab. Clicking on the preview image opens the detail view of the selected artwork, which first presents the artwork in an exhibition setting.\nScrolling down, you will find all further details about the artwork: reference number, availability status, genre, dimensions, technique, material, and year of creation. Title and price may also be displayed, but they are not available for every artwork."

            "question": "Can I purchase an artwork?",
            "answer": "Each artwork displays an availability status in the detail view. If the status shows \"AVAILABLE\", the artwork is for sale. If you are interested in purchasing an original or a print, you need to submit a request via our contact form.\nFurther information can be found in the footer under the \"Shipping & Return\" tab. If you have additional questions, we are happy to answer them as part of your inquiry through the contact form."

For prints, you can choose between a canvas print and a paper print, as well as select framing, stretching, etc. For more information, please check out the \"Prints\" tab in the navigation bar."

            "question": "How do I know whether I can purchase an original or a print of a particular artwork?",
            "answer": "In general, the availability status in the gallery detail view indicates whether an artwork is available or not. Since prints (copies) are made upon request, we do not keep any prints in stock. For some artworks where the original is no longer available, a professional scan is available, allowing prints to be created.\nTo find out if an artwork is available in your desired format, please send us a request via the contact form with the subject \"Specific Request\"."
