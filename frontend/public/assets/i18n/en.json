My imagination was a constant companion, especially when it came to decorating spaces or coordinating colors in harmony.",
                "block2": "However, painting and creating pictures often had to take a backseat. Between the demands of my career and family responsibilities, I often lacked the time and peace needed for it. But I still found ways to express my creativity through other projects. For example, I was given the opportunity to organize and design a Christmas market, which also brought me great joy. Yet, deep down, I knew that one day painting would again take a prominent place in my life - when the time was right.",
                "block3": "When my professional life came to an end, this space finally opened up for me. I could now devote myself fully to painting and began learning the basics of acrylic painting, step by step. I also learned to trust and follow my intuition. Today, I enjoy expressing my thoughts, feelings, and sometimes even my wishes on canvas, free from external constraints.",
                "block4": "I've got to realize:\nHappiness belongs to those who believe it is never too late to start something new."
